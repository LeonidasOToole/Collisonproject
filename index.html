<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>

<p>The Collison brothers became billionares by coding stripe, shuppa and CROMA. The collison brothers started coding from the age of 8. <br> Shuppa was coded by the two brothers in 2007. Shuppa is a app for shopping. <br> Stripe was made by the Collison brothers in 2010. The brothers encourage Kids to code by doing projects and entering competitions such as <a href="https://www.softwareengineering.ie/tecs-programme-with-ise-and-patch/">TECS</a> and <a href="https://www.joinpatch.org/">Patch</a> <br></p>
Since 2020 I have been learning to code using Mimo and codemonkey here are the links to those two websites. <br> <br>
